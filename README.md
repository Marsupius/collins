# RuneLitePluginProject
Semester Project for PSU IST 261, Runelite Plugin and mobile Interface/App
Download RuneLite here https://runelite.net
This is the guide I was following https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Building-with-IntelliJ-IDEA#troubleshooting
I was stuck at the "Building the project" step where you run the maven build
I used the JDK form this link  https://adoptopenjdk.net as well as the 11.0.12 from here https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html
